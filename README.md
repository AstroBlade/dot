These are my dot files. I'm primarily a [MacOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/) user, but I occasionally use [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/), or another Arch based Linux distribution; so that's where I take my cue. The main things here are: 

1. My [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) configuration. 
2. [My Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) configuration.
3. My [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) configuration.
4. My [Qutebroswer](https://qutebrowser.org/) configuration.
5. Snippets for [Auto Hot Key](https://www.autohotkey.com/) & [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/). 
6. Miscellaneous other things: [BitBar Plug-ins](https://getbitbar.com/) and Apple Scripts. 

I mainly use these apps: Vim & the Shell for standard writing; normally in the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) or [Fountain](https://fountain.io/) format. I'm not a programmer, so I haven't customized these apps to make those kinds of tasks easier, the way that many users do. 

# My Shell
