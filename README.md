<p>These are my dot files. I'm primarily a <a href='https://www.apple.com/macos/'>MacOS</a> user, but I occasionally use <a href='https://manjaro.org/'>Manjaro</a>, or another Arch based Linux distribution; so that's where I take my cue.</p>

<p>These are my dot files. I've primarily been a <a href='https://apple.com/macos/'>MacOS</a> user for most of the time I've been collecting dotfiles, but I've recently switched to Linux. I primarily use <a href='https://www.archlinux.org/'>Arch</a>, <a href='https://arcolinux.com/'>Arco</a>, <a href='https://manjaro.org'>Manjaro</a>, or some other Arch based distro; so that's where I take my que. I also run Debian or Ubuntu on any server type systems I have (just for stability), so I also make sure my dotfiles work there as well.</p>

**The main things here are:**
1. My [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) configuration. 
2. My [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) configuration.
3. My [Awesome Window Manager](https://awesomewm.org/) configuration.
4. My [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) configuration.
5. My [Qutebroswer](https://qutebrowser.org/) configuration.
6. Snippets for [Auto Hot Key](https://www.autohotkey.com/) & [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/). 

I mainly use these apps: Vim & the Shell for standard writing; normally in the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) or [Fountain](https://fountain.io/) format. I'm not a programmer, so I haven't customized these apps to make those kinds of tasks easier, the way that many users do.
